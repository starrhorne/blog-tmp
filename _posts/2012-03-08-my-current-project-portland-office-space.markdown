For anyone who's interested, we recently launched a new site to help
people find office space for lease in portland. It's a rails app, with a
lot of coffeescript and scss and has really helped refine a lot of the
ideas I have about structuring front end code.

You can find it at [Portland Office Space For Lease](http://www.officespace.com/Portland-OR)

We have a lot of great things in the works. I'll be discussing some of
the more interesting technical challenges in upcoming posts, and
(possibly) at railsconf.
